        Create a new BTreeNode. You do not need to edit this class at all, but you can. Be sure to leave the following attributes:

        * my_addr stores the address of this object (self)
          In other words, given a node address a, a == get_node(a).my_addr.

        * parent_addr stores the address of the parent node.

        * index_in_parent stores the location of this node in the parent's key list
          For example, if the parent has children [c1, c2, c3], then c1 should have
          index_in_parent == 0, c2 should have it 1, etc.

        * is_leaf keeps track of if this node is a leaf node or not.

        * keys stores the keys that this node uses to index, sorted ascending.
          If self.is_leaf, then foreach index i over range(len(keys)),
        * self.data[i] contains the data element for a key keys[i]
        * Likewise, if not self.is_leaf, then self.children_addrs[i]
          contains the address of a child node whose keys fall between
          keys[i-1] and keys[i] according to BTree rules.
          You can have each key represent either the max value of the left child
          or the min value of the right child.


        For instance, if keys = [10, 20, 30, 40]:
         children_addrs[0] should point to another node whose keys are all less than 10.
         children_addrs[1] should point to another node whose keys are all between 10 and 20.
         children_addrs[2] should point to another node whose keys are all between 20 and 30.
         children_addrs[3] should point to another node whose keys are all between 30 and 40.
         children_addrs[4] should point to another node whose keys are all greater than 40.
        Where "point to" means storing the address of that node.
